# Review

Recreation of a game reflecting the gameplay of a popular game known as "[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)".
Wordle is a word-guessing game where players aim to guess a five letter word in 6 or less guesses. After each guess the game provides color-coded feedback for each letter. Green indicating the letter is in the correct position, yellow indicating the letter is in the word but in the wrong position and grey meaning the letter is not in the word at all.
![Wordle example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9f25e12-5efa-4083-859b-bc1675a52e6b)

Players will win if they guess the word in six or less attempts, if they don't get the word the word is then revealed. The word rotates daily to create a new challenge for players each day.

This project is intended to apply this concept to the world of Persona. I want the player to submit different Persona names, receive feedback, and try to discern the Persona based on it's affinity with the elements.

#### Recreations

This style of game has piqued the interest of many players, including those that may not enjoy word puzzle games. There have already been many recreations of this game in different genres, most involving guessing a character.

These games also feature their own special game-modes that are more unique to their own universe.

# Conditions

	- Feedback box for every element upon guessing

# Development
#### First Design
![Persona_Weakness_Guessing_Mockup_Troy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a90a040-d4f4-4acd-b19d-68b434984a5d)

First UI, designed for guessing specifically weaknesses of the given Persona. It features a centre piece for an affinity selector as a way to submit your guess.
##### Pros
- Easy on the eyes
- Resembles the style of [fusion calculators](https://chinhodado.github.io/persona5_calculator/indexRoyal.html#/list)
- Possible alternate game mode idea
##### Cons
- Does not meet the conditions for how the gameplay should be (due to a miscommunication problem on my behalf)
- UI is not intuitive, does not make sense at first glance

*Currently waiting for a new graphic while working on the functionality*

#### Current state as of 21/12/2024
